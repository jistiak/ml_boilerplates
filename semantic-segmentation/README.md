# Multiclass Semantic Segmentation

Multiclass semantic segmentation is the task of assigning a class label to each pixel of an image. The goal is to segment an image into different regions or objects of interest, with each region being assigned a unique class label. This task is important in many computer vision applications such as autonomous driving, medical image analysis, and robotics.

## Relevant Concepts.

Some of the key concepts and techniques involved in multiclass semantic segmentation include:

- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
- Encoder-Decoder Architecture
- Upsampling and Skip Connections
- Loss Functions (e.g., Cross-Entropy Loss)
- Data Augmentation Techniques

In multiclass semantic segmentation, CNNs are commonly used as the underlying model architecture. Encoder-decoder networks are used to extract features from the input image, followed by upsampling layers that gradually recover the original resolution of the image. Skip connections are also used to combine features from different layers of the encoder with corresponding layers in the decoder to improve performance.

Loss functions such as cross-entropy loss are used to measure the difference between the predicted segmentation and the ground truth labels. Data augmentation techniques such as random scaling, cropping, and flipping are also used to increase the size of the training set and improve the robustness of the model.
